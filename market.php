				<div class="main text-content">
					There is no denying that there has been an explosion in crypto-currency and blockchain. In fact, blockchain-based businesses have so far this year raised more capital via ICOs than through traditional venture capital. The total crypto market cap now stands at a huge $87 billion.	Match this with the Global online sports betting market which was valued at $205 billion this year and things look interesting.
				</div>
				<div class="main text-content">
					Sports betting has become the fastest growing market segment within online gambling worldwide, accounting for nearly half of the total online betting market. We believe that the online sports betting market offers opportunities for coin usage that far exceeds many other ICOs currently offered. Our goal is to become the number 1 platform for crypto-currency gamblers to bet on sports.

			<h1 id="bitcoin-header">Why Bitcoin Betting is the Next Big Thing</h1>
			<p class="main">The online betting industry has lacked innovative ideas for a while. Odds are massively in favour of the bookmaker, payment methods are outdated and regularly winning players are restricted or banned. Better Betting is different. The main advancement is losing the ‘middle man’. Using blockchain	we can build sportsbook clients that operate with no human or business entity in the middle. The system is safe, the software and transactions are provably fair and robust. Also, there is no requirement for a licensed entity as there is no central intermediary. Furthermore you have the opportunity to access jurisdictions where dealing with operators in illegal. Add on the ease of paying for a bet through BETR currency and the fact that you can make larger bets, and you can see why Better Betting is the future of betting.</p>
