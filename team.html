				<h3>Adriaan Brink</h3>
				<span class="small">Founder</span>
				<p>
					<strong>iCoins</strong>Founder (2007) pioneer of Crypto-Currency
				</p>
				<p>
					Brink started professional programming on ICL and UNIVAC mainframes performing statistical analysis of large surveys in 1984.
				</p>
				<p>
					Having witnessed the potential of the internet and the success of the UK National Lottery, in early 1995 the idea was born for an Internet based lottery. Operating out of Liechtenstein Brink established InterLotto - the world’s first legal Internet lottery and quickly established its position as a leading e-commerce site in Europe. In 1997 the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies reached agreement to become the major beneficiary and the site was renamed PLUS Lotto.
				</p>
				<p>
					As CEO of The International Lottery in Liechtenstein Foundation, the operator of the lottery, Brink architected the systems and directed the design and development team. He also took care of marketing, sales and charity relationships.
				</p>
				<p>
					In 1998 Brink was a founding director and CTO of Earthport (www.earthport.com) – a UK based Payment Services Company specializing in direct from bank Internet payment mechanisms. Earthport is listed on AIM in the UK.
				</p>
				<p>
					In 2001 Brink formed Zabadoo AG and bought the lottery systems from Earthport. Zabadoo expanded the markets to include new 3rd party partners marketing branded lotteries.
				</p>
				<p>
					In late 2004 Brink joined the team at Mahjong Mania to bring for money, multiplayer internet Mahjong to the world. Mahjong Mania was the principal business activity of TSX listed company Dynasty Gaming Inc. (TSX:DNY). He was President of Mahjong Systems Limited for 4 years and was instrumental in pioneering multiplayer Mahjong on the Internet.
				</p>
				<p>
					In 2007 Brink formed iCoins Limited and introduced his new concept in the way money should move on the Internet. iCoins was an idea ahead of its time and many concepts were similar to Bitcoin.
				</p>
				<p>
					In 2010 Brink re-focused his development resources on apps for smart phones and social networks. He has released a number of these including a mobile sportsbook (iphone, ipad, android, blackberry) and some innovative Facebook apps.
				</p>
				<p>
					In 2011 Brink formed Socialitize Ltd to develop and operate sports betting oriented apps on Facebook and mobile. Socialitize owns and operates the 2BET2 sports prediction game on Facebook (www.2bet2.com), smart phones and tablets.
				</p>
				<p>
					Since February 2015 Brink has been consulting to Gamesys Ltd in London, UK building a new sports book.

				<h3>Ronnie O’Sullivan</h3>
				<span class="small">Advisor</span>
				<p><strong>The Greatest Snooker Player</strong> to Ever Live</p>

				<p>
					“Rocket” Ronnie O'Sullivan, OBE is widely regarded as one of the greatest snooker players of all time. He is noted for his rapid playing style, mercurial temperament, and his ambivalent relationship with the sport, from which he has taken prolonged sabbaticals and repeatedly threatened to retire.
				</p>
				<p>
					A childhood snooker prodigy, O'Sullivan made his first century break at the age of 10, and his first maximum break when aged 15. He turned professional in 1992, at the age of 16, and soon earned the nickname "The Rocket", because of his rapid playing style. He achieved his first major professional success when he won the 1993 UK Championship at the age of 17 years and 358 days, making him the youngest player ever to win a ranking title—a record he still holds. He is also the youngest player to have won the Masters, having captured his first title in 1995 at the age of 19 years and 69 days.
				</p>
				<p>
					His record in Triple Crown events now stands at five World Championships, a record seven Masters, and five UK Championship titles. His career total of 28 ranking puts him in joint third place and his estimated career earnings of just under 9 million pounds put him in second place on snooker's all-time prize money list.
				</p>
				<p>
					Known as a prolific break-builder, O'Sullivan holds the record for the most competitive century breaks with 882. He also holds the record for the most ratified maximum breaks in professional competition (13), and for the fastest competitive maximum break, compiled in 5 minutes and 20 seconds.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ronnie is hugely popular in Asia and has a passion for sports betting.

					Lyceum Media was founded reactively to exploit the experience and abilities of its founders and to consolidate their considerable experience in journalism, casino marketing and PR into one entity. Once these personalities joined, they immediately recognized the void in the market for media and PR experts and practitioners that understood the underpinnings of the iGaming business. After that revelation, the founders began to understand that there has never been a time in the history of business where customer acquisition has served such a core function to a business. Raising your brand's profile and acquiring customers efficiently and creatively in this competitive marketplace is the key to a successful iGaming operation.
