                <h3>Adriaan Brick</h3>
                <span class="small">Founder</span>
                <p>
                    <strong>iCoins</strong>Founder (2007) pioneer of Crypto-Currency
                </p>
                <p>
                    Brink started professional programming on ICL and UNIVAC mainframes performing statistical analysis of large surveys in 1984.
                    Having witnessed the potential of the internet and the success of the UK National Lottery, in early 1995
                    the idea was born for an Internet based lottery. Operating out of Liechtenstein Brink established InterLotto
                    - the world’s first legal Internet lottery and quickly established its position as a leading e-commerce
                    site in Europe. In 1997 the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies reached
                    agreement to become the major beneficiary and the site was renamed PLUS Lotto. As CEO of The International
                    Lottery in Liechtenstein Foundation, the operator of the lottery, Brink architected the systems and directed
                    the design and development team. He also took care of marketing, sales and charity relationships. In
                    1998 Brink was a founding director and CTO of Earthport (www.earthport.com) – a UK based Payment Services
                    Company specializing in direct from bank Internet payment mechanisms. Earthport is listed on AIM in the
                    UK. In 2001 Brink formed Zabadoo AG and bought the lottery systems from Earthport. Zabadoo expanded the
                    markets to include new 3rd party partners marketing branded lotteries. In late 2004 Brink joined the
                    team at Mahjong Mania to bring for money, multiplayer internet Mahjong to the world. Mahjong Mania was
                    the principal business activity of TSX listed company Dynasty Gaming Inc. (TSX:DNY). He was President
                    of Mahjong Systems Limited for 4 years and was instrumental in pioneering multiplayer Mahjong on the
                    Internet. In 2007 Brink formed iCoins Limited and introduced his new concept in the way money should
                    move on the Internet. iCoins was an idea ahead of its time and many concepts were similar to Bitcoin.
                    In 2010 Brink re-focused his development resources on apps for smart phones and social networks. He has
                    released a number of these including a mobile sportsbook (iphone, ipad, android, blackberry) and some
                    innovative Facebook apps. In 2011 Brink formed Socialitize Ltd to develop and operate sports betting
                    oriented apps on Facebook and mobile. Socialitize owns and operates the 2BET2 sports prediction game
                    on Facebook (www.2bet2.com), smart phones and tablets. Since February 2015 Brink has been consulting
                    to Gamesys Ltd in London, UK building a new sports book.

                    Created the first ever Internet Sportsbook in 1996 <strong>Intertops.com</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ian is perhaps best known in the industry for proposing and then creating the first ever Internet Sportsbook in January 1996
                    - Intertops.com. After 21 years, the first and the best is still online! As Technical Director of Intertops
                    since its founding in 1983, Ian oversaw many new innovations such as the first Sportsbook to accept single
                    match bets across the board, owner of the first online bookmaking license issued in the UK and many technical
                    advances with voice recognition telephone betting systems, OCR betting coupons and the introduction of
                    a personalized betting coupon printing system. Following the success of Intertops.com, Ian was one of
                    the first to integrate an online casino, payment systems and wrote one of the industry’s best known affiliate
                    programs. During 2003, Ian founded Mahjong Mania in Montreal, Canada. Mahjong Mania created the first
                    aggregated cash-play Mahjong game and was successful in signing up many of the best known online casinos
                    and software suppliers. During 2005 Mahjong Mania reversed into Canadian publicly traded company which
                    later became Dynasty Gaming. After Canada, Ian moved to Singapore where he created a Live Bingo system
                    and a P2P Mobile Betting Solution as well as being consulted by many major online gaming companies in
                    the region. Over the last few years, Ian has been developing a P2P Betting Exchange incorporating an
                    In-Play Cricket Betting game which can be applied to Blockchain technologies.

                <span class="small">Advisor</span>
                <p><strong>The Greatest Snooker Player</strong> to Ever Live</p>

                <p>
                    “Rocket” Ronnie O'Sullivan, OBE is widely regarded as one of the greatest snooker players of all time. He is noted for his
                    rapid playing style, mercurial temperament, and his ambivalent relationship with the sport, from which
                    he has taken prolonged sabbaticals and repeatedly threatened to retire. A childhood snooker prodigy,
                    O'Sullivan made his first century break at the age of 10, and his first maximum break when aged 15. He
                    turned professional in 1992, at the age of 16, and soon earned the nickname "The Rocket", because of
                    his rapid playing style. He achieved his first major professional success when he won the 1993 UK Championship at
                    the age of 17 years and 358 days, making him the youngest player ever to win a ranking title—a record
                    he still holds. He is also the youngest player to have won the Masters, having captured his first title
                    in 1995 at the age of 19 years and 69 days. His record in Triple Crown events now stands at five World
                    Championships, a record seven Masters, and five UK Championship titles. His career total of 28 ranking puts
                    him in joint third place and his estimated career earnings of just under 9 million pounds put him in
                    second place on snooker's all-time prize money list. Known as a prolific break-builder, O'Sullivan holds
                    the record for the most competitive century breaks with 882. He also holds the record for the most ratified
                    maximum breaks in professional competition (13), and for the fastest competitive maximum break, compiled
                    in 5 minutes and 20 seconds. Ronnie is hugely popular in Asia and has a passion for sports betting.
