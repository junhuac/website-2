		</ol>
		<h2>Appendix</h2>
		<h3>Risks</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>The participation and purchase of the BETR tokens carries significant risk. If any of the risks outlined below materialise it could have a severe negative impact on the ICO or the Company (including but not limited to the impossibility of continuing a business or the bankruptcy of the Company) and the Purchasers may lose all the funds invested into the ICO.</li>
			<li>Prior to purchasing the BETR tokens the Purchaser should carefully consider the risks outlined below, the information stated in these Terms, the Whitepaper or in any other relevant document and, to the extent necessary, consult a lawyer, accountant, and/or tax professionals in Estonia and in the jurisdiction the Purchaser is a resident.</li>
			<li>There is a risk in regard to the changes to the legislation and taxes as well as to the interpretation of the legislation and the taxable status of the ICO and the tokens by the respective regulators and authorities.</li>
			<li>Cryptocurrencies and financing through cryptographic tokens (ICO) are being, or may be, subject to regulatory control by various regulatory bodies within different jurisdictions. The approach by the regulators towards the cryptocurrencies, cryptographic tokens and ICO-s may change rapidly. The Company could be impacted by the regulatory enquiries or actions in different jurisdictions from time to time which could impede or limit the ability to carry out the ICO, allow respective Purchasers from different jurisdictions to participate in the ICO or continue the development of the Platform. This uncertainty significantly rises the risks connected with participating in the ICO or with acquiring and using of the BETR tokens.</li>
			<li>The BETR tokens are intended to be placed for trading on a secondary market for cryptographic tokens after the ICO, however, the Company cannot guarantee this. The circulation and trading with the BETR tokens after the ICO on the secondary market depends whether the BETR tokens are admitted to trading by the respective secondary market exchange provider. There is a risk that the BETR tokens will not become available for trading on the secondary market.</li>
			<li>There is a risk of lack of stability and functioning of the secondary market exchanges for the cryptocurrencies as these exchanges are new and unregulated. This makes the secondary market exchanges more vulnerable to the cases of fraud, business or technical failure or new regulations limiting their functioning. There is also a risk that an active trading market for the BETR tokens shall not develop or sustain.</li>
			<li>There is a risk that the price of the BETR tokens could experience extreme volatility from time to time as the cryptographic tokens are and have been subject to extreme fluctuations in price. The volatility of the BETR tokens could differ between different jurisdictions as a result of approach towards the cryptographic tokens and the ICOs by the respective regulators within these jurisdictions.</li>
			<li>The Website, the Whitepaper, these Terms and any other document related to the ICO may include forward-looking statements, including expected technical or economic results. There is a risk that these forward-looking statements differ significantly as there is a possibility that the predictions in the forward-looking statements shall not occur. Thus, the Purchaser shall not be able to base his/her expectations for future success or failure or on the forward-looking statements.</li>
			<li>The BETR token software is developed on the Ethereum blockchain. Being an open source project, Ethereum software could be updated or amended from time to time by anyone and it is not possible to foresee the impact of such update or amendment on the Ethereum or BETR tokens developed on its software. However, any update or amendment to Ethereum could lead to unexpected outcome that could have significant effect on the BETR tokens.</li>
			<li>There is a risk that the BETR tokens, Wallets or any other website or platform are open to attacks by the hackers which could result for the Purchaser or the Company in losing any of the cryptographic currencies or other tokens (including but not limited to the BETR tokens) or have severe impact on the ICO or the Platform.</li>
			<li>There is a risk that anyone may introduce weaknesses or bugs into the core infrastructural elements of the BETR tokens causing the system to lose BETR tokens for one, several or all the Purchasers.</li>
			<li>There is a risk of stealing the BETR tokens or the cryptographic currencies which shall be transferred in between the Company and the Purchaser.</li>
			<li>There is a risk that the Platform may not be developed in the manner and to the extent as described in the Whitepaper regardless of the amount of funds raised within the ICO.</li>
			<li>There are unknown amount of technical risks and uncertainties related to the ICO, the cryptocurrencies, the BETR tokens and any other element of the ICO, as well as the Platform.</li>
			<li>The Company has disclosed the information on risks related to the purchase of the BETR tokens and participation in the ICO to the extent reasonably foreseeable at the time of entering into these Terms.</li>
